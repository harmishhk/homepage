abstract = "Navigation in human environments is a cooperative task and needs to be treated as it is. Humans concurrently assist and comply with each other. To achieve comparable efficiency, a robot needs to predict human trajectories and plan its own trajectory accordingly. We present a navigation planner that is able to plan such cooperative trajectories simultaneously respecting the robot's kinematic constraints and avoiding other non-human dynamic obstacles. Besides adapting the robot trajectory, the planner is also able to proactively propose co-navigation solutions especially in confined spaces."
