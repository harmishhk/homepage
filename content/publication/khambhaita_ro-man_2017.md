abstract = "This paper focuses on requirements for effective human robot collaboration in interactive navigation scenarios. We designed several use-cases where humans and robot had to move in the same environment that resemble canonical path-crossing situations. These use-cases include open as well as constrained spaces. Three different state-of-the-art human-aware navigation planners were used for planning the robot paths during all selected use-cases. We compare results of simulation experiments with these human-aware planners in terms of quality of generated trajectories together with discussion on capabilities and limitations of the planners. The results show that the _human-robot collaborative planner_ performs better in everyday path-crossing configurations. This suggests that the criteria used by the _human-robot collaborative planner_ (_safety_, _time-to-collision_, _directional-costs_) are possible _good_ measures for designing acceptable human-aware navigation planners. Consequently, we analyze the effects of these social criteria and draw perspectives on future evolution of human-aware navigation planning methods."
