# Hi!

My current work revolves around autonomous electric vehicles. It involves developing automated planning techniques for computing feasible and optimal trajectories for tele-operation of vehicles. I am a member of the [Autonomous System and Robotics](http://asr.ensta-paristech.fr/) group lead by [David Filliat](https://perso.ensta-paristech.fr/~filliat/eng/).

During my doctoral thesis work at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/en) I was involved in developing methods to make a robot move safely and comprehensibly in human centered environments. My doctoral thesis was supervised by [Rachid Alami](https://homepages.laas.fr/rachid/). Before that I have collaborated with [Geert-Jan Kruijff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gjkruijff/) during my stay at the [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/web?set_language=en&cl=en) and with [Erwin Prassler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erwin-prassler-0005ba6) during my master's thesis work.

My current work is partially supported by the ITEA-3 project [Dangun](https://itea3.org/project/dangun-1.html).
