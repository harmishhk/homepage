# Hi!

My current work revolves around human-aware robot navigation. It involves developing methods to make a robot move safely and comprehensibly in human centered environments. I am interested in developing socially intelligent robots using automated planning, optimization and machine learning techniques.

I mostly interact with my supervisor [Rachid Alami](http://homepages.laas.fr/rachid/) and fellow doctoral students of the [Robotics and InteractionS](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/ris) group. In the past I have collaborated with [Geert-Jan Kruijff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gjkruijff/) and [Erwin Prassler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erwin-prassler-0005ba6).

My current work is supported by the EU-projects [SPENCER](http://spencer.eu/) and [MuMMER](http://mummer-project.eu/).
